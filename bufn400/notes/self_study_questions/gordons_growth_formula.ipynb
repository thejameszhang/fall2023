    "is a continuously compounded expected return. Verify intuitively (or with math) the expected result that Gordon's growth formula becomes\n",
    "$$P(t_n) = \\frac{D(t_n)}{\\bar{r} - \\bar{g}}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the denominator is not dependent on $n$ in the summation. Thus, it is like a constant and we can pull it out of the summation. This is due to one of the assumptions with Gordon's Growth Formula, which is the expected return of the risky asset and the growth rate of the dividends are constant over time. Mathematically, this makes sense because the closer $\\bar{r}$ and $\\bar{g}$ are, the greater the price is, and this makes intuitively because that means the growth rate of diviends and the expected return of the asset are both large."

    "On the other hand, if you are more interested in the valuation of the stock relative to its income (dividends), then the price-dividend ratio $1/\\kappa$ would be more suitable.
